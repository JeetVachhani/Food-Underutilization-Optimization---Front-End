# FUO (Frontend)

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the FUO application.

More information about the application can be found in "FUO: README.pdf".

## Installation


These are the “local” installation instructions for macOS (preferred). Extra installation information will be needed if using Windows.

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager are both installed on your system.

First, clone the backend from this [repository](https://github.com/MoonJiao123/FUO-backend) to your local machine, and follow the installation instructions listed in that repo.

Next, clone the current repository (frontend) to your local machine.

Then, open a terminal window from the root of the current (frontend) git repository.

Navigate to the directory with package.json in a shell and run ``npm i``. 

Maybe run ``npm i`` again for good measure.

To start the app locally, run ``npm start`` in the directory that contains ``package.json`` in a terminal shell.
